# STK
The Sodium ToolKit (STK) is an open source graphical toolkit used for creating well-integrated user interfaces for the Table Salt Project. The toolkit is better integrated in the Table Salt Project, but can be used on (mostly) any Linux distribution.<br/>
## For developers
STK is based on QML, but is unique in many ways.<br/>
STK contains a library of prebuilt user interface components with inbuilt light and dark theme variants.<br/>
ChlorIDE (in development) is the recommended development environment for creating user interfaces with STK.<br/>
